- Born in <strong>Yokohama</strong>, Japan. Raised in <strong>Fairfax</strong>, CA.

- Attended <strong>UC San Diego</strong> (2021-2025), go tritons!  
  - My research experience began in undergrad when I completed an honor's thesis in [Dr. Robert Knight's](https://knightlab.neuro.berkeley.edu/) lab studying event-related potential responses in scalp and intracranial EEG during prediction paradigms.<br /><br />

- Lived in <strong>San Francisco</strong> for the next 3 years working as a Clinical Research Coordinator at UCSF's [Memory and Aging Center](https://memory.ucsf.edu/) with [Dr. Virginia Sturm](https://canlab.ucsf.edu/). In this lab we were interested in measuring emotion dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease and neurodevelopmental disorders via autonomic signals, MRI, and coding facial expression. 
  - SF will always have a special place in my heart. Reach out if you need dumpling recs or hidden gems of Golden Gate Park.<br /><br />

- Moved to <strong>San Diego</strong> in the heart of the pandemic (summer 2020) to start graduate school at [UCSD](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/graduates/phd-program/index.html) with [Dr. Bradley Voytek](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/bradley-voytek.html).
  - Living in San Diego has been a dream! I love running, camping, beach days, and all things outdoors in the sunshine.
